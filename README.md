Two notebooks covering the material in the second python lab
- Concepts are covered in concepts.ipynb 
- The working example is in code_example.ipynb 


Notebooks can be viewed statically in github. 

If the notebooks are not rendering in github, go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy the url of the notebook:

- Concepts: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/imilas/291PyLab/blob/master/concepts.ipynb
- Code Example: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/imilas/291PyLab/blob/master/code_example.ipynb

To dynamically view and modify the notebooks:
1. Download code
2. Install jupyter-notebook
3. Start the jupyter server and navigate to the given localhost path(browser might open automatically)
4. Open the desired notebook in the jupyter UI
